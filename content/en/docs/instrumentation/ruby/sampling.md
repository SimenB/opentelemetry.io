title: Sampling

[Sampling](/docs/concepts/sampling/) is a process that restricts the amount of
traces that are generated by a system. The Ruby SDK offers several
[head samplers](/docs/concepts/sampling#head-sampling).

## Default behavior

By default, all spans are sampled, and thus, 100% of traces are sampled. If you
do not need to manage data volume, don't bother setting a sampler.

## TraceIDRatioBased Sampler

When sampling, the most common head sampler to use is the TraceIdRatioBased
sampler. It deterministically samples a percentage of traces that you pass in as
a parameter.

### Environment Variables

You can configure the TraceIdRatioBasedSampler with environment variables:

```shell
export OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER="traceidratio"
export OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG="0.1"
```

This tells the SDK to sample spans such that only 10% of traces get exported.

### Configuration in Code

You can also configure the TraceIdRatioBased sampler in code. Here's an example:

```ruby
require 'opentelemetry/sdk'
require 'opentelemetry/exporter/otlp'
require 'opentelemetry/instrumentation/all'

# sample 10% of traces
sampling_percentage = 0.1
sampler = Samplers.trace_id_ratio_based(sampleing_percentage)

tracer_provider = OpenTelemetry.tracer_provider(sampler: sampler)

OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  # Other initialization code goes here too...
  c.tracer_provider = tracer_provider
end
```
